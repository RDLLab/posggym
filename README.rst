####

The goal of this library is to provide implementations of Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) environments coupled with dynamic models of each environment, all under a unified API. While there are a number of amazing open-source implementations for POSG environments, very few have easily useable dynamic models that can be used for planning. The aim of this library is to fill this gap.

Another aim it to provide open-source implementations for many of the environments commonly used in the Partially-Observable multi-agent planning literature. While some open-source implementations exist for some of the common environments, we hope to provide a central repository, with easy to understand and use implementations, in order to make reproducibility easier and to aid in faster planning research.

Implemented Environments
------------------------

Full Model Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These environments include model which are fully defined, in the sense they include implementations of every component of the POSG model, as opposed to only a generative black-box function.

- Multi-Access Broadcast Channel (MABC)


Generative Model Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Two-Path (TP)
