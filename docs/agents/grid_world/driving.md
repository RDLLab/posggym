# Driving

These policies are for the <a href='../../../environments/grid_world/driving'>Driving environment</a>. Read environment page for detailed information about the environment.

## Generic
These policies can be used for any version of this environment.



```
env = posggym.make("Driving-v1")
```


| Policy | ID | Valid Agent IDs | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `A0Shortestpath` | `Driving-v1/A0Shortestpath-v0` | All | Follows shortest path to destination, doesn't go full speed, and stops if it observes another a car at any distance (aggressiveness=0.0) |
| `A40Shortestpath` | `Driving-v1/A40Shortestpath-v0` | All | Follows shortest path to destination, doesn't go full speed, and stops if it observes a car near edge of observation range (aggressiveness=0.40) |
| `A60Shortestpath` | `Driving-v1/A60Shortestpath-v0` | All | Follows shortest path to destination, goes up to full speed, and stops if it observes a car a medium distance away (aggressiveness=0.60) |
| `A80Shortestpath` | `Driving-v1/A80Shortestpath-v0` | All | Follows shortest path to destination, goes up to full speed, and stops if it observes a car a very short distance away (aggressiveness=0.80) |
| `A100Shortestpath` | `Driving-v1/A100Shortestpath-v0` | All | Follows shortest path to destination, goes up to full speed, and ignores other vehicles (aggressiveness=1.0) |
## grid=14x14RoundAbout-num_agents=2

| Policy | ID | Valid Agent IDs | Description |

| `RL2` | `Driving-v1/grid=14x14RoundAbout-num_agents=2/RL2-v0` | All | Deep RL policy trained using PPO and self-play. |
| `RL3` | `Driving-v1/grid=14x14RoundAbout-num_agents=2/RL3-v0` | All | Deep RL policy trained using PPO and self-play. |
| `RL4` | `Driving-v1/grid=14x14RoundAbout-num_agents=2/RL4-v0` | All | Deep RL policy trained using PPO and self-play. |
| `RL5` | `Driving-v1/grid=14x14RoundAbout-num_agents=2/RL5-v0` | All | Deep RL policy trained using PPO and self-play. |
