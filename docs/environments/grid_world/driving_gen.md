The Generated Driving Grid World Environment.

This is the same as the [Driving](/environments/grid_world/driving) Environment
except that a new grid is generated at each reset.

For environment attributes see [Driving](/environments/grid_world/driving)
environment class documentation.

Arguments
---------

- `num_agents` - the number of agents in the environment (default = `2`).
- `obs_dim` - the local observation dimensions, specifying how many cells in front,
    behind, and to each side the agent observes (default = `(3, 1, 1)`, resulting
    in the agent observing a 5x3 area: 3 in front, 1 behind, 1 to each side.)
- `generator_params` - the parameters to use for generating the grid
    (default = "14x14"). This can either be a string specyfing one of the supported
    sets of params (can be "7x7", "14x14", "28x28") or a dictionary with the
    following keys:
    - `width` - width of the grid
    - `height` - height of the grid
    - `max_obstacle_size` - max size of an obstacle
    - `max_num_obstacles` - maximum number of obstacles in the grid
- `n_grids` - the number of different grids to generate, if provided then `n_grids`
    will be generated and these will be cycled through for each reset. If `None`
    then a different, possibly unique, grid will be generated each episode
    (default = `None`).
- `shuffle_grid_order` - whether to shuffle the order in which different grids
    appear. Only has any effect if `n_grids > 1` (default = `True`).

Available variants
------------------

The DrivingGen environment comes with a number of pre-built sets of grid generator
parameters which can be passed as an argument to `posggym.make`:

| Name    | Grid size | max obstacle size | max num obstacles |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| `7x7`   | 7x7       | 2                 | 21                |
| `14x14` | 14x14     | 3                 | 42                |
| `28x28` | 28x28     | 4                 | 84                |


For example to use the DrivingGen environment with the pre-build `7x7` set of
generation parameters and 2 agents, you would use:

```python
import posggym
env = posggym.make('DrivingGen-v1', generator_params="7x7", num_agents="2")
```
