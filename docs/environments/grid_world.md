The unique dependencies for this set of environments can be installed via:

````bash

There are five three classic POSG environments: Multi-Access Broadcast Channel (MABC), Rock-Paper-Scissors, and Multi-Agent Tiger.

Most classic environments are configurable via arguments specified in each environment's documentation.
